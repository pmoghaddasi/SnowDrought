# Snow Drought to Hydrologic Drought Progression

This repository contains code for the paper "Snow Drought to Hydrologic Drought Progression: A Machine Learning and Probabilistic Analysis." The code implements LSTM models to analyze the relationship between Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and streamflow in snow-dominated basins and quantifies the progression from snow drought to hydrologic drought.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Documentation on the basin SWE data format and sources
- `src/`: Source code for basin identification, LSTM modeling, and drought analysis
