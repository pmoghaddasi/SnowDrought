# Data for Snow Drought to Hydrologic Drought Progression

This directory contains SWE (Snow Water Equivalent)  time series data for all CAMELS basins.

## Data Sources

The SWE data in this repository is derived from the following sources:

1. **UAZ**: University of Arizona Daily 4km Gridded SWE (1981-2021)
   - Source: https://doi.org/10.5067/0GGPB220EX6A

2. **Daymet**: Daily 1km gridded SWE (1980-present)
   - Source: https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2129

3. **SNODAS**: Snow Data Assimilation System (2003-present)
   - Source: https://doi.org/10.7265/N5TB14TC

All data has been preprocessed to calculate basin-averaged SWE values for each CAMELS basin.
